# Template Support

`sempcfg` employs the [FreeMarker template engine](https://freemarker.apache.org/) to provide template support for configuration file, so you could have more flexibility to define your PS+ broker.

The most used features are:

## [Include](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_include.html)

The `include` directive lets you literally include different parts of configuration file together.  For example, you could have the queue's configuration in a separated file [queues.json](queues.json),  then include it into the message vpn configuration file [demo_vpn.json](demo_vpn.json).

## [Import](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_include.html)

The `import` directive is used to define your variables together in a separated file. For example, you could have the number and name prefix of queue defined in the file [vars.ftl](vars.ftl), then import it in the [queues.json](queues.json) file.
